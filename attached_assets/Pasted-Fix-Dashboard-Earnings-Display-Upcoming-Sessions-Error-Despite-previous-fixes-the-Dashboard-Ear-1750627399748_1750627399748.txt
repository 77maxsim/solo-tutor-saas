Fix Dashboard Earnings Display + Upcoming Sessions Error

Despite previous fixes, the Dashboard "Earned This Month" card still shows incorrect data for Oliver. It only displays ¥80.00, but according to Supabase and the Activity page, Oliver has received multiple payments this month (see screenshot from All Activity > Payments with ~10 confirmed payments on June 14th alone).

✅ Important context:

The Earnings Page shows the correct values (e.g. ¥2,714.00).

The Dashboard earnings logic should already use the shared earningsCalculator, yet the numbers don’t match for Oliver.

This bug does not affect other tutors like Max, whose Dashboard earnings display correctly.

Oliver’s timezone is Asia/Shanghai, and we previously adjusted session UTC timestamps for his records, so it's possible this has caused timezone logic inconsistencies.

The "Earned This Month" card seems to incorrectly exclude valid paid sessions for Oliver, even those that occurred mid-month (not just around UTC edge cases like June 1st).

🎯 What to fix:
Audit the logic for calculating Earned This Month in the Dashboard, especially:

Are you converting session_start from UTC to the tutor’s timezone correctly (e.g., Asia/Shanghai)?

Are you using .isSame(dayjs(), 'month') with local or UTC values?

Is the session marked paid = true AND the tutor_id matching?

Verify session filtering is based on session_start and not deprecated columns (like time or date).

Ensure the same calculation code from the Earnings page is applied to the Dashboard, without any Oliver-specific overrides or custom filters.

When clicking "Upcoming Sessions", the entire page breaks with "Error loading upcoming sessions".

Please trace the query and frontend logic for this route.

Make sure the session_start filter doesn’t exclude valid future sessions due to timezone misalignment or RLS policy issues.

This bug is likely connected to the same misinterpretation of timezones or broken filters on tutor_id.

📎 Summary of what works and what doesn't
Feature	Status
Earnings Page	✅ Correct
Dashboard (Max)	✅ Correct
Dashboard (Oliver)	❌ Wrong earnings (¥80 instead of ~¥2,700)
All Activity (Oliver)	✅ Correctly shows many June payments
Upcoming Sessions (Oliver)	❌ Page broken with error

✅ Constraints:

Do not use deprecated time or date columns.

Do not break the working logic on the Earnings page.

Use session_start in UTC, convert to tutor's timezone for filtering.

Respect RLS (Row-Level Security) — fetch only sessions belonging to the logged-in tutor.

Keep visual UI and earnings card layout unchanged.
