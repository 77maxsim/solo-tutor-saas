 Fix Dashboard & Earnings Discrepancies

We have successfully migrated to session_start and session_end and removed the deprecated time field. However, multiple issues remain on the Dashboard:

🧩 Current Issues
Dashboard Earnings Cards (Today / Week / Month)

Always show ¥0.00, even though the Earnings Page displays the correct totals (¥2,714.00 this month, etc.).

Expected behavior: Should match the logic and results of the Earnings page.

Expected Earnings (30d / Month / All)

Values are inconsistent or incorrect across tabs.

Examples:

30d: ¥30,854.00

Month: ¥7,380.00

All: ¥76,994.00

These differences do not reflect actual totals or session logic.

Dashboard: Active Students = 0

This is incorrect, as the Earnings page shows 50 active students.

Same with “Sessions This Week” – shows 0 on Dashboard, while data exists in backend.

✅ What Is Working
Earnings page logic is correct and up to date.

session_start is being used across all new logic (✅ good).

RLS is enforced and sessions are scoped by the logged-in tutor.

⚠️ Constraints
Please make the fix without breaking any of the following:

❌ Do not reference or query the deprecated time or date columns.

❌ Do not break existing Earnings Page logic (this is our source of truth).

✅ Use session_start and session_end (in UTC), and convert to tutor's timezone (e.g., Asia/Shanghai) where filtering by day/week/month is required.

✅ Dashboard UI must remain unchanged.

✅ Must respect Supabase RLS – fetch only sessions for the logged-in tutor.

⚠️ Fix logic centrally (e.g., shared utils or hook) to ensure DRY code and reduce future bugs.

🧪 Suggested Steps
Audit the Dashboard.tsx and compare calculations with Earnings.tsx. Ensure they both use the same centralized logic.

Use a shared earningsCalculator (if already created) or build a util that:

Converts session_start from UTC to tutor timezone.

Groups sessions by time window (today, this week, this month).

Filters only paid: true sessions.

Fix Active Students Count on the Dashboard:

Use same query/logic as Earnings page.

Define an “active student” as one who had a session in the last 30 days.

💡 Optional Improvements
Add basic Jest unit tests for the new earningsCalculator or shared query logic to avoid regression in future.

Consider logging the raw filtered sessions in dev mode to verify the logic is correctly applied in both places.
