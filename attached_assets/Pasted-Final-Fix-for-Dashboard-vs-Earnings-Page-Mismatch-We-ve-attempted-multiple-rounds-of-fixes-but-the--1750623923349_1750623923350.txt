Final Fix for Dashboard vs Earnings Page Mismatch
We’ve attempted multiple rounds of fixes, but the issue still persists.

❌ What is still broken (as of latest test):
Dashboard earnings cards still show:

¥0.00 Today

¥0.00 This Week

¥0.00 This Month
→ Despite the Earnings page showing:
✓ ¥2,714.00 this month and ✓ Sessions this month: 33

Active Students = 0 on Dashboard
→ Despite Earnings page correctly showing 50 active students

Expected Earnings (30d / Month / All) values are still inconsistent with each other (logic unclear or broken)

✅ What is working correctly:
Earnings page logic and data (correct totals, active students, sessions this month)

Database schema uses session_start and session_end in UTC

Deprecated time and date fields are not used

⚠️ Constraints (REPEAT – DO NOT BREAK THESE):
❌ Do NOT query deprecated time or date columns.

✅ Use only session_start (UTC) with conversion to tutor timezone for filtering by:

Today (local)

This week

This month

✅ Must respect Supabase RLS — only fetch sessions of the logged-in tutor

✅ Earnings page logic must not be broken

✅ Dashboard visual structure must remain unchanged

🎯 REQUIRED FIXES
✅ Fix all earnings cards on the Dashboard

Ensure they use the same logic and filters as Earnings page.

Use the shared earningsCalculator or move the EarningsPage logic to a shared utility if not already done.

Show correct amounts for Today, This Week, and This Month.

✅ Fix "Active Students" on Dashboard

Use the same query/filter as Earnings page.

"Active" means: students with at least one session in the past 30 days.

✅ Fix Expected Earnings logic

“30d” = next 30 days from now (use session_start)

“Month” = next calendar month

“All” = all future sessions from today

🧪 FINAL VERIFICATION (DO NOT SKIP)
✅ Log filtered session count and student count to console
✅ Ensure values match exactly between Dashboard and Earnings.tsx
✅ Confirm calculation parity for all 3 timeframes

Please verify each fix step-by-step and share console debug output if needed. Do not assume the issue is resolved until Dashboard matches Earnings page values exactly.
