Add Section Titles with Icons for Better Scannability

Objective:
Add descriptive section titles with relevant emoji icons throughout the TutorTrack application to improve visual hierarchy and make content easier to scan and navigate.

Target Pages & Sections:

Dashboard (client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx):

📊 Quick Stats (for the stats cards section)
📅 Upcoming Sessions
💰 Payment Overview
🕒 Recent Activity
Students (client/src/pages/students.tsx):

🧑‍🎓 Student Overview (for the main students table)
Earnings (client/src/pages/earnings.tsx):

💰 Earnings Summary (for the stats cards)
🧑‍🎓 Earnings by Student (for the student breakdown table)
Calendar (client/src/pages/calendar.tsx):

📅 Weekly Schedule / Monthly Schedule (already has titles, could add icons)
Profile (client/src/pages/profile.tsx):

👤 Personal Information (for the profile form section)
Activity (client/src/pages/activity.tsx):

📋 All Activity (for the activity feed)
Implementation Guidelines:

Icon Selection:

Use Unicode emoji icons for consistency and simplicity
Suggested icons: 🧑‍🎓 (Students), 💰 (Earnings/Money), 📅 (Calendar/Sessions), 📊 (Stats/Analytics), 🕒 (Time/Recent), 👤 (Profile), 📋 (Activity/Lists)
Styling:

Add icons directly to existing CardTitle components where sections already exist
Use consistent spacing between icon and text (e.g., className="flex items-center gap-2")
Maintain existing text sizing and styling
Placement:

Add to CardHeader > CardTitle components for main content sections
Consider adding to page headers where appropriate
Focus on major content sections rather than every small component
Accessibility:

Ensure icons don't interfere with screen readers
Icons should be decorative and not convey essential information
Expected Outcome:
Users should be able to quickly scan each page and identify different sections at a glance, improving the overall user experience and making the interface more intuitive to navigate.
