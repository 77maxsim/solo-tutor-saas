🛠 Replit Prompt – Fix Earnings Calculations on Dashboard & Inaccurate Expected Earnings

The deprecated session.time field has been fully removed, and most components have already been migrated to use session_start and session_end UTC timestamps.

✅ The following bugs have already been fixed:

Students page

Calendar display and drag/drop rescheduling

Session editing modal

Earnings page (totals and breakdowns)

❌ Remaining issues to fix:

Dashboard: Earnings Calculations (Today / This Week / This Month)

The earnings cards on the dashboard still show ¥0.00 for Today / Week / Month.

But the same calculations do work correctly on the Earnings page.

✅ Please reuse or centralize the correct logic from the Earnings page and apply it to the dashboard as well.

🕓 All logic must be based on session_start and session_end (not time) and must respect the tutor’s timezone via formatUtcToTutorTimezone() or similar utility.

Dashboard: Expected Earnings Totals Are Incorrect

The "Expected Earnings" cards on the dashboard show inconsistent totals:

“30d” shows one number (e.g. ¥30,854 from 380 sessions)

“Month” shows a much lower number (e.g. ¥7,380 from 91 sessions), despite similar session volume

These discrepancies likely stem from:

Comparing different date ranges (e.g. 30 rolling days vs calendar month)

Possibly wrong timezone or timestamp comparison

Sessions that fall outside the intended date window

✅ Please review the logic for calculating expected earnings in all modes (30d, Month, All) and ensure:

All future sessions are based on session_start in UTC

Time is converted correctly to local tutor timezone

Date range logic is consistent across filters

Amounts are summed accurately based on rate and duration

📌 Notes:

Please do not reintroduce or depend on session.time, which has been permanently dropped.

Keep changes minimal and compatible with the updated structure.

Make sure calculations are correct across different timezones.

Validate everything using the live Supabase session_start and session_end data.
