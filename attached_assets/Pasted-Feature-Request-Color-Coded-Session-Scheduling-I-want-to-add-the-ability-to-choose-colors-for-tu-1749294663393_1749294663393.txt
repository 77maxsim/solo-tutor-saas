Feature Request: Color-Coded Session Scheduling

I want to add the ability to choose colors for tutoring sessions when scheduling them, similar to Google Calendar's color picker functionality. Here are the requirements:

Core Functionality:

Add a color picker/selector in the Schedule Session Modal that allows users to choose from a predefined set of colors
Store the selected color in the database with each session
Display sessions with their chosen colors on the calendar view
Show the colored indicators/backgrounds in all session lists (upcoming sessions, dashboard widgets, etc.)
Technical Requirements:

Database Schema: Add a color field to the sessions table (string field to store hex color codes or color names)
Color Palette: Provide 8-10 predefined colors that work well with the current UI theme and have good contrast
Default Behavior: If no color is selected, use a default color (current blue theme)
UI Components:
Color picker in the schedule session modal
Color indicators on calendar events
Color badges/indicators in session lists and cards
Visual Design:

Colors should be vibrant but not overwhelming
Maintain good contrast with text overlays
Use circular color swatches in the picker
Show a subtle border around the selected color
Colors should work well in both the calendar grid and list views
Implementation Areas:

Update the schedule-session-modal.tsx to include color selection
Modify the database schema and session interfaces
Update calendar events styling in calendar.tsx
Update session cards in dashboard widgets and upcoming sessions
Ensure color persistence across all session displays
User Experience:

Color selection should be optional and intuitive
Users should be able to change colors when editing sessions
Colors should be consistently applied across all views where sessions appear
For recurring sessions, all sessions in the series should inherit the same color
Can you help me implement this color-coding system for sessions?
