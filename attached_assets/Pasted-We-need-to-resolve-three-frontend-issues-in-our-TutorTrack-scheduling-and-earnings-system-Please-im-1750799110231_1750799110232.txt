We need to resolve three frontend issues in our TutorTrack scheduling and earnings system. Please implement the following fixes carefully. ⚠️ Do not make any changes to the Supabase schema, fields, or permissions. Supabase structure must remain untouched.

✅ Fix 1: Missing Timezone Display in Schedule Modal
Problem:
When scheduling a session by clicking the calendar grid (empty slot), the modal initially shows the user's timezone correctly (e.g., Asia/Shanghai), but when the same modal is opened using the "Schedule Session" button from the sidebar, the timezone is missing.

Task:
Ensure the timezone is always shown next to the date/time field regardless of how the modal is opened. This display should rely on the user's local system timezone or a fallback to default (Europe/Kyiv if undefined).

Keep existing UTC logic intact.

Do not change the session_start or timezone handling logic already in place.

✅ Fix 2: Duplicate Schedule Modals on Calendar Slot Click
Problem:
Clicking on an empty time slot in the calendar opens two "Schedule Session" modals at once. This doesn’t happen when clicking the sidebar button, which opens it correctly once.

Task:
Audit and fix the calendar event handler so it doesn't trigger multiple modal mounts.

Prevent double rendering or accidental double openModal() calls.

Apply consistent logic with the sidebar modal trigger.

Test with multiple clicks to ensure modal doesn't open twice.

✅ Fix 3: Overdue Payments Calculation Limited to First 5 Sessions
Problem:
The "Overdue Payments" total on the dashboard only reflects the 5 most recent unpaid sessions shown on the widget. However, there are many more unpaid sessions which should be included in the total.

Task:
Fix the total overdue calculation logic so that the amount reflects all unpaid sessions, not just the ones currently rendered.

Use the same filtering conditions already implemented (paid = false AND session_start < NOW()).

Do not increase or render all overdue sessions in the dashboard—just ensure the total is correctly calculated from all overdue entries.

☑️ Constraints
Do not modify, add, or remove any fields in Supabase.

Keep all session logic based on session_start, session_end, and duration, in UTC.

Do not reintroduce date or time fields anywhere in the logic.

Preserve all existing timezone-aware conversion and session rendering logic.

After the fixes are applied, please test:
